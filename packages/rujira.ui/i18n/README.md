# i18n for the Kujira Network

## Translations

We use a string-based lookup as opposed to key-based. See [gettext](https://hexdocs.pm/gettext/Gettext.html) for a similar implementation. A template is available at ./translations/template.json.

When contributing a new language, please name the json file according to [RFC 5646](https://gist.github.com/msikma/8912e62ed866778ff8cd)
